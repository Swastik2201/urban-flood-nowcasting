"""Real road navigation that steers around flooding.

Routes come from OSRM, the open-source engine behind a lot of OpenStreetMap
routing. It is free, needs no key, follows actual streets and will hand back
several alternative routes for the same journey.

The part that matters here is what we do with those alternatives. OSRM ranks
them by driving time and knows nothing about water. So each candidate route is
sampled along its length, scored against the predicted flood depth near every
sample, and the one that stays driest is chosen — even when it is slower. If
the fastest route is flooded and a slower one is not, that is precisely the
decision worth making, and it is the decision a navigation app cannot make
today because nobody tells it where the water is.

If OSRM cannot be reached, the caller falls back to the straight-line planner
in route_planner.py, and the page says so rather than pretending.

      2. If all of them cross water, force routes through dry waypoints.
      3. If still nothing is clear, return the driest and say so plainly.

    different per traveller rather than the same route with a different label:

      "time"      quickest, wet or not. A fire tender wades where a car cannot,
                  and an ambulance held up by a diversion has its own body count.
      "safety"    quickest of the routes under the threshold. The default, and
                  what a car wants.
      "driest"    lowest worst-point, even if it is slower. A scooter rider
                  cannot see a pothole or an open manhole through muddy water,
                  so avoiding the water matters more than saving five minutes.
      "shortest"  least distance among the passable ones. On foot, an extra
                  kilometre is worse than an extra five minutes in a car.

    `min_alternatives` guarantees there is always something to compare against.
    OSRM often returns a single route, and "here is your only option" is not
    navigation — so if fewer than this many come back, detours are built through
    dry waypoints until there are enough, whether or not the first one was wet.

    `fetch` and `fetch_via_fn` exist so a caller can supply cached versions of
    the two network calls. The scoring and the choosing must stay uncached —
    they depend on the forecast, which changes every time the user moves the
