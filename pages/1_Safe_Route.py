"""Turn-by-turn navigation that routes around water.

Real roads, from OSRM. It returns several ways to make the same journey and
ranks them by driving time, knowing nothing about flooding. We re-rank them by
how much standing water each one crosses and recommend the driest.

The recommendation is a default, not a verdict. Every route that was
considered can be selected, and selecting one redraws the map and rebuilds the
statistics for that route — so the person can see for themselves what the
detour is buying and decide whether it is worth it.

OSRM returns several ways to make the journey and ranks them by driving time.
It knows nothing about flooding.

Each route is then sampled every 120 metres. Every sample takes the risk of
the nearest drain, fading to nothing 400 metres away — a road 50 m from a
flooded gully is wet, a road 400 m away is not. A route's score is its worst
sample, and its "through water" figure is how much of its length sits above
the threshold.

The quickest **clear** route is the one recommended. If nothing is clear, the
driest one is recommended and the page says so rather than implying the
journey is safe. You can still select any of the others — the numbers above,
the map and the directions all follow the selection, not the recommendation.

The limitation worth knowing: risk is inferred from ten drain locations, so
the spatial resolution of the flood map is coarse. More drains, or a proper
inundation raster, would sharpen it. The routing logic does not change.
