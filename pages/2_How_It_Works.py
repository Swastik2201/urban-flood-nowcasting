**Runoff — the rational method.** `Q = C · i · A`. Rain intensity `i` over
catchment area `A`, times a runoff coefficient `C` for how much of it actually
runs off rather than soaking in. Standard urban drainage design, in every
textbook and in the CPHEEO manual. `C` is composed here from the land cover of
each catchment — see the Terrain tab.

**Capacity — Manning's equation.** `Q = (1/n)·A·R^(2/3)·√S`. The consequence
that matters is the exponent: discharge scales with cross-sectional area to
the power 5/3. So a drain 75% choked does not carry 25% of its design flow, it
carries about **10%**. This is the single biggest reason paper capacities
mislead, and it is why cleaning drains buys more headroom than it looks like
it should.

**Routing.** The drains are a directed graph — each one flows to the nearest
lower drain of equal or higher rank, primaries reach the sea, and a low point
with nowhere to go is pumped. Water is routed through it every 15 minutes.

**Surcharge.** A drain discharging into one that is already under water loses
capacity it nominally has, because the pipe below is running full. Without
this the network is only bookkeeping.

**Tide.** A storm drain discharges by gravity through an outfall in the sea
wall. When the sea is higher than the outfall, that discharge collapses. This
is why the design standard says "at low tide" and why it matters so much.

**Ponding.** Whatever cannot get down the pipe stays on the surface. Volume
over the area it spreads across gives a depth in centimetres, capped at how
deep that spot can get before water runs off overland instead.

**What happens to your photo.** The app solves for the blockage figure that
would have made the model reproduce the depth you reported — holding everything
else fixed and routing through the whole network each time. That is inverse
calibration: what a hydrologist does by hand, done automatically and shown with
its working. Blockage is the right target because it is the input the model is
least certain about, and the one a resident standing in the water has real
evidence on.

**Why one photo does not rewrite a survey.** A single report moves the estimate
by a fifth of what it implies. Five agreeing reports move it fully, and no
amount of reporting shifts it more than 25 percentage points. Crowd evidence
should accumulate, not stampede.

**When the app says so instead.** If no blockage value can reproduce the
reported depth, the page flags it rather than nudging the number anyway. That
gap is informative — it points at something outside the model, like a blocked
outfall or a pump that was off, and routes it to a human instead of burying it
in an average.

**Where this leads.** Over a monsoon this collects exactly the dataset the
model is currently missing: labelled photographs with depths, times and
locations. That is the input a learned model would need, and this is the
mechanism that gathers it.
